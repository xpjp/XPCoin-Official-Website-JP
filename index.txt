Welcome to the world of XP

Experience Points (XP) are a completely independent, platform agnostic incentive rewards token and digital currency combined enabling you to earn XP through video games, activities, sports, education and conservation and then spend at participating vendors either online, in game, or on the high street. The concept of real value rewards merged with the blockchain technology of Bitcoin provides an innovative approach to in game currencies moving towards a unified platform, similar to the standards applied to mobile phone charges for example.

This approach keeps the digital currency completely independent from any bank, central authority, government and corporation but at the same time allows them all to collaborate and submit proposals, open source code, documentation and content that benefits the other participants and parties in the network.

Please take time to browse the website and get a feel for what XP is about and how it can act both as a reward incentive, and as a digital currency which has no national boundary, is almost free to transact, and is perfect in the fight against monetary fraud.
